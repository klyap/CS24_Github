# These instructions call getVolume() on a initialized Shape subclass
# stored in 8(%ebp), ignoring callee/caller save registers and
# float returns. 
# 
# First the initialized object is a Shape data pointer (ie "*this").
# To access the associated subclass getVolume function, we need to
# dereference once to get the Shape class pointer and 
# dereference again to get the getVolume function pointer. 
# Then we can push the Shape data pointer as the argument
# and call the function pointed at by the getVolume function pointer.


movl 8(%ebp), %ebx	# Store the shape data pointer
movl (%ebx), %ecx	# Dereference to get shape class pointer
movl (%ecx), %ecx	# Dereference to get getVolume function pointer
push %ebx			# Push argument to getVolume (shape data pointer)
call (%ecx)			# call getVolume
