1. In find_space_loop: Increment %esi by 2.
Since we want to sum the lengths and those are stored in odd memory locations,
the counter needs to increment by 2 instead of 1.

2. In write_loop: Increment %edi by 1
To write to next memory location in output, need to increment %edi.

3. In find_space_done: Need to store callee save registers before malloc
Callee save registers are %eax, %ecx, %edx (Lecture 6).
Don't need %edx later on in code, so don't need to store.
%eax is only used to store output at the very end so there is no value here
to store at this time either.
Only need to push %ecx onto stack.

4. In find_space_loop:
