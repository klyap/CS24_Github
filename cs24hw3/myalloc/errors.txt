What happens if myfree() is called on:
1. An address that did not originate from myalloc
2. Address that is contained within a memory block returned by myalloc
	In both these cases, the statement referencing header->size will actually access some address and multiply the value there by -1. 

3. Address that has already been freed
	The block will be re-marked as being taken (ie. header->size > 0) since 
	myfree() simply multiplies the header value by -1.
