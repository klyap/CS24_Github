This code retrieves value from M[8 + ebp] into register %eax.
Then it multiplies this value by a constant 3 using signed multiplication,
storing product in %eax.
The constant 12 is added to the value in %eax.
This value is sign multiplied by the value M[8 + ebp] and stored in %eax.
The constant 17 is subtracted from the value in %eax.

The final computed value is:
x(3x + 12) - 17
